## Unit Converter
### By: Derek Tan
### Time: 8/26/2022 to ?

### How to Setup and Run Project:
 1. Install the _Red Hat Java Extension Pack_ for Visual Studio Code if you do not have it. Make sure it is enabled!
 2. Fork or download this repo.
 3. In _Java Projects_, click the _Debug_ Button besides "unitconverter". After you do so, the application should be built and launched.

### Summary:
This is a simple length unit converter but with a twist: _no_ if else chains for all specific conversions! I have made this not only to fill my GitHub as an unofficial portfolio, but also to review some good old Java.

### TODO:
 1. Add more Metric and Imperial units?
 2. Add history for quick re-entry of common conversions.
