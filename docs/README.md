### How to Setup and Run Project:
 1. Ensure that you have the Java JDK installed on your computer for Java SE 18 or higher.
 2. Install the _Red Hat Java Extension Pack_ for Visual Studio Code if you do not have it. Make sure it is enabled!
 3. Fork or download this repo.
 4. In _Java Projects_, click the _Debug_ Button besides "unitconverter". After you do so, the application should be built and launched.

### Project Tools:
 - My Editor: VS Code
 - Language: Java (18)
 - VCS: Git for Windows

### Info:
This is a simple length unit converter without long `if else` chains! I have made this not only to fill my GitHub as an unofficial portfolio, but also to review some good old Java. The code is commented and well named for clarity. Feel free to fork or change code, but please credit me as the original programmer.

### Version History:
 - `0.1.10`: Fixed cross convert bug between metric and imperial.
